# Block Categorization System Implementation

## Overview

The block categorization system has been successfully implemented to enforce proper placement rules for different types of coding blocks in the MegaCreative visual programming environment.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Block Type Categories

Each block in `coding_blocks.yml` now has a `type` field that categorizes it:

- **EVENT**: Script entry points (Diamond blocks) - `DIAMOND_BLOCK`
- **ACTION**: Execution blocks (Cobblestone, Iron, Netherite, Granite) - `COBBLESTONE`, `IRON_BLOCK`, `NETHERITE_BLOCK`, `POLISHED_GRANITE`
- **CONDITION**: Logic checks (Oak Planks, Obsidian, Redstone, Bricks) - `OAK_PLANKS`, `OBSIDIAN`, `REDSTONE_BLOCK`, `BRICKS`
- **CONTROL**: Flow control (Emerald, End Stone) - `EMERALD_BLOCK`, `END_STONE`
- **FUNCTION**: Function management (Lapis, Bookshelf) - `LAPIS_BLOCK`, `BOOKSHELF`

### 2. Position-Based Placement Rules

The system enforces these placement rules:

#### Blue Line (X = 0) - Start of coding lines:
- ✅ **Allowed**: EVENT, CONTROL, FUNCTION blocks
- ❌ **Forbidden**: ACTION, CONDITION blocks

#### Gray Lines (X > 0) - Continuation of coding lines:
- ✅ **Allowed**: ACTION, CONDITION blocks  
- ❌ **Forbidden**: EVENT, CONTROL, FUNCTION blocks

### 3. User Feedback

When a player tries to place a block in the wrong position, they receive:
- Clear error message in Russian explaining the restriction
- Helpful hint about correct placement
- Block placement is cancelled

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified

1. **`coding_blocks.yml`**
   - Added `type` field to all block definitions
   - Maintains backward compatibility with existing actions

2. **`BlockConfigService.java`**
   - Enhanced `BlockConfig` class to include type field
   - Added helper methods:
     - `getBlockCategory(Material)` - Gets block category
     - `isControlOrEventBlock(String)` - Checks if category requires blue line
     - `isControlOrEventBlock(Material)` - Material-based check

3. **`AutoConnectionManager.java`**
   - Enhanced `onBlockPlace` event handler with validation logic
   - Position-based rule enforcement before auto-connection
   - Comprehensive logging for debugging

### Core Logic

```java
// Block placement validation in AutoConnectionManager
String blockCategory = blockConfigService.getBlockCategory(block.getType());
int blockX = location.getBlockX();

if (blockX == 0) { // Blue line
    if (!blockConfigService.isControlOrEventBlock(blockCategory)) {
        // Cancel placement and show error
    }
} else { // Gray line
    if (blockConfigService.isControlOrEventBlock(blockCategory)) {
        // Cancel placement and show error
    }
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Valid Placements

```
Line 1: [DIAMOND_BLOCK] → [COBBLESTONE] → [OAK_PLANKS] → [COBBLESTONE]
        (EVENT)           (ACTION)        (CONDITION)     (ACTION)
        
Line 2: [EMERALD_BLOCK] → [COBBLESTONE] → [REDSTONE_BLOCK]
        (CONTROL)         (ACTION)        (CONDITION)
```

### Invalid Placements (Will be blocked)

```
Line 1: [COBBLESTONE] → [DIAMOND_BLOCK]  ❌ ACTION block on blue line
        
Line 2: [DIAMOND_BLOCK] → [EMERALD_BLOCK] ❌ CONTROL block on gray line
```

## Error Messages

- **Russian Error Messages**: User-friendly messages in Russian for better UX
- **Hint System**: Helpful tips about correct placement
- **Clear Categorization**: Explains which block types go where

## Benefits

1. **Improved Code Structure**: Forces logical script organization
2. **Better Learning Curve**: Users learn proper coding flow naturally
3. **Reduced Confusion**: Clear rules prevent common placement mistakes
4. **Maintainable Scripts**: More organized and readable visual code

## Configuration

The system is fully configurable through `coding_blocks.yml`. To add a new block type:

```yaml
NEW_BLOCK_MATERIAL:
  name: "My Custom Block"
  type: "ACTION"  # or EVENT, CONDITION, CONTROL, FUNCTION
  description: "Description of functionality"
  actions:
    - "customAction"
```

## Future Enhancements

This foundation enables future improvements:

1. **Visual Indicators**: Color-coded lines based on allowed block types
2. **Smart Suggestions**: GUI could filter blocks based on current position
3. **Advanced Rules**: More complex placement logic for specialized blocks
4. **Template Validation**: Ensure saved scripts follow proper structure

## Testing

The system has been:
- ✅ Compiled successfully with Maven
- ✅ Integrated with existing AutoConnectionManager
- ✅ Tested for backward compatibility
- ✅ Validated with comprehensive error checking

## Integration Points

The categorization system integrates seamlessly with:
- **BlockPlacementHandler**: Respects existing block creation logic
- **AutoConnectionManager**: Adds validation before auto-connection
- **ServiceRegistry**: Uses dependency injection pattern
- **Configuration System**: Loads from `coding_blocks.yml`

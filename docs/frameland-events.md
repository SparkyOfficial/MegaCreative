```

### 14. World Mode Events

```

## Event Data Context

Each event provides contextual data that can be accessed in scripts:

### Standard Event Data
- `player` - The player who triggered the event
- `world` - The world where the event occurred
- `location` - The location of the event (if applicable)
- `timestamp` - When the event occurred

### Event-Specific Data
- Combat events include damage amounts, causes, and attackers
- Inventory events include items, slots, and click types
- Movement events include locations and distances
- Custom events include user-defined data

## Performance Features

### High-Performance Event Handling
- **O(1) Event Lookup** - Events are cached by type for instant script finding
- **Async Execution** - Non-critical events execute asynchronously
- **Thread-Safe Operations** - Concurrent event handling without conflicts
- **Event Statistics** - Built-in performance monitoring and analytics

### Event Caching System
```java
// Events are automatically cached for optimal performance
// Cache is rebuilt when worlds/scripts change
frameLandEventManager.refreshEventCaches();
```

### Event Analytics
```java
// Get detailed event execution statistics
Map<String, Object> stats = eventManager.getEventStatistics();

// Example output:
// {
//   "onPlayerJoin": {
//     "count": 150,
//     "total_time_ns": 50000000,
//     "avg_time_ns": 333333,
//     "avg_time_ms": 0.333
//   }
// }
```

## Configuration & Setup

### Automatic Initialization
The FrameLand event system initializes automatically when MegaCreative starts:

```java
// Event manager is available through service registry
FrameLandEventManager eventManager = plugin.getServiceRegistry().getFrameLandEventManager();
```

### Event Registration
Events are automatically registered for all creative worlds. Scripts with matching event blocks will execute when events occur.

### Custom Event Triggering
```java
// Trigger custom events programmatically
eventManager.triggerCustomAction(player, "special_ability", data);
eventManager.triggerScoreChange(player, "points", oldScore, newScore, "quest_complete");
```

## Script Integration

### Event Block Types
Create code blocks with these event actions to respond to events:
- Use diamond blocks for `onPlayerJoin`
- Use redstone blocks for `onPlayerQuit`
- Use TNT blocks for `onPlayerDamage`
- Use chest blocks for `onInventoryClick`
- And many more...

### Event Context in Scripts
Scripts automatically receive event context data through the FrameLand placeholder system:

```
player[name]~ joined the server!
You took apple[damage]~ damage from apple[damage_cause]~
Your score changed from apple[old_score]~ to apple[new_score]~
```

## Best Practices

### Performance Optimization
1. Use specific event types rather than broad ones when possible
2. Keep event scripts lightweight for high-frequency events (onPlayerMove, onTick)
3. Use async execution for non-critical operations
4. Monitor event statistics to identify performance bottlenecks

### Event Organization
1. Group related events together in the same world
2. Use descriptive script names for event handlers
3. Document complex event interactions
4. Test event sequences thoroughly

### Security Considerations
1. Validate event data before processing
2. Limit custom event triggering to authorized players
3. Monitor event execution times and frequencies
4. Implement rate limiting for player-triggered events

## Migration from Basic Events

### Upgrading Existing Scripts
Existing scripts continue to work without changes. New FrameLand events provide additional capabilities:

```
// Old basic event
onJoin -> sendMessage[Welcome!]

// New FrameLand event with context
onPlayerJoin -> sendMessage[Welcome apple[player_name]~! First time: apple[first_play]~]
```

### Enhanced Event Data
FrameLand events provide much richer context data than basic events, enabling more sophisticated script logic and better user experiences.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Events not triggering**: Check if scripts are enabled and event blocks are correct
2. **Performance issues**: Review event statistics and optimize high-frequency handlers
3. **Custom events not working**: Verify event manager initialization and triggering code

### Debug Tools
```java
// Get event statistics for debugging
Map<String, Object> stats = eventManager.getEventStatistics();

// Reset statistics to track specific issues
eventManager.resetStatistics();

// Check if regions are defined correctly
boolean inRegion = eventManager.isLocationInRegion(location, "region_name");
```

This comprehensive event system brings FrameLand-level functionality to MegaCreative, enabling sophisticated interactive experiences and script-driven gameplay mechanics.
